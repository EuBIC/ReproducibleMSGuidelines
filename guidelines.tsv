One aspect of this problem is that bioinformatic analysis are increasingly complex and greatly influence the outcome of a study. Current bioinformatic analysis commonly consist of multiple tools and algorithms, each with its own set of parameters. Recording all of these settings in full detail is rarely possible in methods sections of a research manuscript. This often leads to vital details about the bioinformatic processing of the data to be missing. In this work, we therefore try to establish:    * A set of guidelines to describe the minimal information required in the bioinformatic methods section of MS-based manuscripts.    * A well-defined checklist of requirements to help authors, reviewers, and editors to assess bioinformatic analyses.   * The required extended information data (supplementary) that needs to accompany any manuscript in order to ensure its reproducibility.  The following guidelines will be focused on studies and manuscripts performed using MS-based technologies (see below). However, the principles of the guidelines can be applied and extended to other omics bioinformatics data analysis. Additionally, these guidelines should enable non-bioinformatics experts as well (when reviewing, for example) to assess whether a manuscript fulfills these guidelines.  ## Conventions Used in this Manuscript  All items are grouped into three categories:  **Bronze**: Minimal requirements to ensure reproducibility. This constitutes the minimal level of compliance with this guideline.  **Silver**: Intermediate level  **Gold**: Fully documented consideration of all bioinformatics aspects.  The guidelines are organized by sections (e.g. Public Data Deposition). Each section provides a checklist of information that must (**Bronze**), should (**Silver**) or could (**Gold**) be provided for each specific technology. If one of the items in the checklist is applied to only a specific set of MS-based technologies, it will be mentioned and tag specifically. The idea behind this approach is to create reusable blocks that can be integrated into other guidelines as well. The current guidelines are design for the following biomedical research fields:   - Proteomics (bottom-up and top-down) - ProteoGenomics*  - Metabolomics  - Lipidomics  - Mass Spectrometry Imaging   **ProteoGenomics** can be considered a specific subfield of MS-based proteomics studies in which more complex analysis are performed.   Some of the rules are design for **meta-analysis** manuscripts. A meta-analysis manuscript is the aggregation/reanalysis of previously published data.   
 Public Data Deposition  We consider public data deposition as a vital requirement for any published study. Therefore:  
Raw data is deposited in a public repository   	Bronze   	 The complete RAW data (ie. the mass spectrometer's raw files, such as `RAW` files for Thermo Fisher instruments) of any MS-based study must be deposited in a public repository to ensure reproducibility. 	all    
The data repository is part of [ProteomeXchange](http://www.proteomexchange.org/)   	Bronze   	The ProteomeXchange Consortium coordinates standard data submission and dissemination guidelines of proteomics data. It encourages open data policies in the field of proteomics and guarantees the long-term maintainability of the data. 	 Proteomics, ProteoGenomics    
Data should be deposited in one of the following repositories: Metabolights, MassIVE   	Silver    	[Metabolights](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/) and [MassIVE](https://massive.ucsd.edu) are the two major archives for metabolomics data in the world. These two archives implement standard protocols for data submission and dissemination of metabolomics data.       	Metabolomics    
Experimental design is deposited in a public repository   	Bronze   	 An accompanying file is made available which describes the experimental design in terms of sample id per raw file / isobaric channel, and fraction identifier, as well as any additional factors relevant to the experiment. This file should be deposited alongside the data in the public repository or must alternatively be submitted as a supplementary file with the manuscript.This file should indicate factors potentially relevant to batch effects (f.e. machine id, lab id, run date and time). If supported, this information should be made available using the repository’s standard method. 	all      
The identifier of the data submission is mentioned in the manuscript   	Bronze   	 	all       
The data must be available at the time of submission for review and must be available publicly at the time of publication. 	Bronze   	The assessment of raw data, or at least the way the data was submitted, is vital to the review process of a scientific publication. This allows reviewers to ensure that the data was deposited in a re-usable way. 	all      
Linked to matched data, e.g. transcriptomics is provided   	Silver   	The accession of the complementary omics data should be provided in the main manuscript. These data should be  available in another public repository (e.g. RNA-seq dataset in ArrayExpress).  	[PXD008960](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/pride/archive/projects/PXD008960) by Ren *et al.* is an example of a proteo-genomics study where RNA-seq data is linked to proteomics data. 	all     
The processed data is deposited in a public repository   	Silver     	The **processed** result files (ie. search result files indicating identified PSMs, peptides, and proteins) are deposited in the same public repository as the raw data. 	all     
For meta-analysis papers, the identifiers of all reanalyzed datasets are mentioned in the manuscript     	Bronze     	For meta-analysis manuscripts where multiple public datasets are reanalyzed with a different approach or bioinformatics workflow, the identifier and the publication of each of these datasets should be cited in the manuscript.     	all      
Acquisition method files are made available together with the Raw data      	Silver   	    	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics    
The mass spectra are provided in the HUPO-PSI standard file format mzML   	Gold    	[mzML](http://www.psidev.info/mzML) is a HUPO-PSI data format that store mass spectrometry data (e.g mass spectra, chromatograms) using controlled vocabulary terms. mzML, is a well tested open-source and XML-based format.    	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics, Metabolomics, Lipidomics  
The identification information (PSMs / Petides / Proteins) are provided in the HUPO-PSI format mzIdentML or mzTab   	Gold   	This relates to the search results. As most proteomics search engines support [mzIdentML](http://www.psidev.info/mzidentml) and [mzTab](http://www.psidev.info/mztab), the files generated by the search engine should be uploaded to the same repository as the mass spectrometer's raw data. 	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics    
The quantitative information is made available in the HUPO-PSI standard file format mzTab    	Gold   	[mzTab](http://www.psidev.info/mztab) is a HUPO-PSI standard file fomat that store proteomics and metabolomics identification and quantification results including: Peptide spectrum matches, Peptides, metabolites and proteins.  	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics, Metabolomics    
Samples are annotated with metadata within the HUPO-PSI files (mzTab) or other standards for experimental design such as IsaTab   	Gold   	  	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics, Metabolomics, Lipidomics  
The identifier to the genomics (e.g. GWAS or RNA-seq) dataset is cited in the manuscript   	Bronze   	In ProteoGenomics studies, sequencing data is an integral part of the dataset. Therefore, this data should also be deposited to a public repository and the respective dataset cited in the manuscript. 	ProteoGenomics    
All 'omics datasets are linked at the repository level 	Silver 	For example PRIDE (for proteomics data) and ArrayExpress (for expression data) support the linking of RNA-sequencing and proteomics datasets. If this feature is supported by the chosen repository, all 'omics datasets should also be linked at the repository level. 	ProteoGenomics   
 Basic Bioinformatics Analysis Description  Section	This section refers to the requirements of how the bioinformatic analysis should be described in a manuscript.   
All used software is named including the exact version and the availability 	Bronze     	The used software must be unambiguously named. This includes, for example, the used download link for public software (including the citation of the corresponding publication if applicable) or reference to the company. The provided information should be sufficient for anyone to retrieve the exact same piece of software (if still available).  	all     
Any non-publicly available / custom scripts are available to the reviewers       	Bronze       	The term `scripts` refers to any short piece of code that was created for the study. Most commonly, these will be custom, in-house R, Python, MatLab, or Perl scripts. This explicitly does not mean that commercial software must be available free-of-charge to the reviewers. 	all      
Newly developed or closed-source in-house developed software is made available to the reviewers for testing 	Bronze      	This refers to software that is developed by the authors / research group / institute. 	all      
If the software is made publicly available, downloads for specific versions of the software are provided, which include the exact version used in the manuscript 	Bronze      	The way to distribute the software must support to download specific versions of the software to enable researchers to reproduce the exact same results. 	all      
All external resources (UniProt, GO, Ensembl, Reactome, etc.) are referenced and the version/release date/date of access documented     	Bronze     	During the downstream analysis different databases are commonly use, for example Uniprot, Intact, Reactome. Some of these databases are used througth R packages, and desktop applications. However, the version of the tool is not enough to reproduce the original results, because the same tool version can be use with different dtabase versions. We recommended to include the version/release/date of the data provider in addition to the tool version.     	all     
The operating system and its version under which the analysis was carried out is specified     	Bronze      	As shown by [DiTommaso et al](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3820) the choice of operating system may have a considerable effect on the generated results even if the same software was used. 	all      
Newly developed software/custom scripts are made publicly available and deposited to a public code hosting platform 	Silver     	All software, including custom scripts (see above) should ideally be deposited at a public hosting platform, such as  GitHub, Bitbucket, or GitLab. This should ensure the long-term availability of the software as well as the option to enable researchers  to retrieve specific versions of the software in the future. 	all     
A README file is provided that specifies the system requirements, installation guide, and instructions for use 	Silver   	This refers to any custom / new software developed by the authors. 	all   
The used software version can be identified through a DOI 	Gold   	Services like https://zenodo.org provide DOIs for software. This simplifies the citation and retrieval of specific software versions. 	all      
Demo data is provided for newly developed software 	Gold   	Next to a README file (see above), a demo dataset is distributed with the software together with a description how to run and what to expect from the provided data. This resembles the idea of vignettes in [R Bioconductor](https://www.bioconductor.org/) packages. If applicable, [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) provide a very good platform to create and distribute such example analyses. 	all    
 Workflow Software  Section	This section refers to cases where a workflow software, such as ProteomeDiscoverer, Galaxy, or OpenMS was used to perform the analysis.  
The workflow file is made available at the time of review   	Bronze   		all     
Workflow files are deposited in the same repository as the public data or the software or submitted as supplementary data    	Silver   	In case of newly developed software that integrates into a workflow system, such a workflow file can be distributed  as a test suite for the software package. 	The ProteomeDiscoverer nodes developed by the Protein Chemistry Facility at the IMP provide example workflows together with their respective nodes. See the [MSAmanda node](http://ms.imp.ac.at/index.php?action=ms-amanda) as an example ([Dorfer et al. J Proteome Res. 2014, 13(8):3679-84](http://pubs.acs.org/articlesonrequest/AOR-6DyVQ3j4YTcGXyaskJvi)) 	all     
 Containers  Section	This section addresses special requirements when using containerized software (such as Docker containers).  
If containers are used in the analysis, they should be referenced following, for example, the BioContainers guidelines 	Bronze 	If containers, such as Docker or Singularity containers, are used in the analysis they should be referenced through stable version numbers. This explicitly relates to not using the ":latest" tag for Docker images as these are bound to change upon new releases of the software. Detailed suggestions can be found in the BioContainers documentation 	all  
If containers are used in the analysis, these should be available in a public repository using non-personal namespaces 	Silver 	If containers, such as Docker or Singularity containers, are used in the analysis they should be available through a public repository, such as Docker Hub. The namespace used to make this image publicly available should not be under a "private", user-based namespace but should use some kind of institutional namespace where long-term availability is ensured. This addresses the risk, that if private namespaces are used and the person changes careers, the namespace might be deleted and the images thus lost. 	all  
Containers should be available in dedicated repositories such as BioContainers 	Gold 	Dedicated namespaces for bioinformatics tools ensure minimum standards of the containers and their long-term availability. Additionally, they have mechanisms in place to also support a wider range of platforms, such as BioConda. 	all  
 RAW File Processing  Section	In proteomics, raw file processing refers to all steps before generating peak lists for the identification step.  
If RAW file processing was performed by a separate tool, this tool including all settings are described    	Bronze     	This should include all settings for signal detection (such as MS and MS/MS peak picking, deisotoping, feature detection) settings if available     	all      
If the software used is not publicly available, the processed RAW data is deposited alongside the original RAW data 	Bronze   	This is only required if custom software was used to process the RAW data. 	all   
  Manual Curation  
If the data were manually curated (for example using Skyline) the curated dataset is deposited alongside the RAW data in a public repository     	Bronze     	Manual curation refers to any manipulation of the original RAW data that was not performed using an automated process. Therefore, the process cannot be sufficiently described and reproduced based on used software settings alone. In such a case, any intermediate data created from such a curation step must be made available to ensure reproducibility. 	all  
Un-curated data is made available alongside the final one     	Gold     	If different data than the original RAW files were used as starting point for the manual curation step, this data should also be made publicly available. 	all     
 Search MS-based Proteomics  
The protein sequence database used including the exact version/date of download (if a release version is not available) are described   	Bronze     	During the protein identification step, the spectrum identification search engine algorithm commonly uses a  protein sequence FASTA database from public resources (e.g. ENSEMBL, Uniprot). If the original FASTA file from the resource is not transform/change and the release number of the file is not available; the exact version/date of the downloaded FASTA file should be provided.   	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics    
The method used to create a decoy database is specified   	Bronze    	During the peptide identification step, the search engine uses a decoy database to statistically access the quality of the peptide identifications. Multiple methods are available to generate the decoy databases (e.g reverse, random, etc). We recommend to mention the strategy used to generate the decoy database in the main manuscript.     	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics    
If a custom (ie. non-publicly available) database was used, this database is deposited in the public repository or submitted as supplementary data   	Bronze   	 This includes databases, where decoy databases were generated using randomization. In ProteoGenomics studies sequencing data is often used to create custom protein databases (FASTA files) for the subsequent identification step. In these cases, such custom FASTA files should be made available to ensure reproducibility. In case of human studies, the files can be access-protected. 	 Proteomics, ProteoGenomics   
Custom spectral libraries should be publicly available 	Bronze    	If custom spectral libraries are used for peptide / protein identification, the libraries should be deposited in the public repository. If the libraries are publicly available, the source, version (if available) or date of download should be mentioned in the manuscript. 	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics    
The search engine(s) including their exact versions is/are specified   	Bronze   	During the identification step a `search engine` is used to map the obtained mass spectra to the corresponding peptide sequence. In this rule, we recommend to report the software version in the main manuscript.    	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics  
All relevant, non-default settings, such as precursor ion tolerance, fragment ion tolerance, in-silico digestion rule (ie. enzyme), allowed missed cleavages, static and variable post-translational modifications are specified   	Bronze   	  	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics    
The methods used to determine the identification false discovery rates (at PSM, peptide and/or protein levels) and the respective thresholds  are specified    	Bronze    	    	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics       
When available, the used parameter/configuration file is deposited alongside the data in a public repository or alternatively submitted as supplementary data    	Silver    	Several search engines are configured through parameter files. If this is supported by the used software, the used parameter files should be either deposited in a public repository (alongside the RAW data) or submitted as supplementary data. 	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics      
 MS-based Quantitative  Section	This section refers to the step in the analysis where quantitative values are derived for the measured molecules. In proteomics, for example, the result of this process is a table with protein expressions and their abundance in the various samples.  
The software used to extract quantitative values including its parameters and version is specified     	Bronze    	This refers to the software to create abundance values from the RAW spectra. For example, the software used to extract precursor ion intensities, or reporter ion intensities etc. 	all  
The method used to aggregate PSM level quantitative values on the peptide and protein levels is specified    	Bronze    	This refers to the step where the measured PSM-level quantitative values are aggregated at the protein level. 	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics     
The method used to perform normalisation is specified including at which level this normalisation was performed (PSM, peptide, or protein)     	Bronze    		Proteomics, ProteoGenomics      
The method used to filter and/or impute missing values is specified including at which level this filtering/imputation was performed (PSM, peptide, or protein)     	Bronze    	   	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics     
 Statistical Analysis  Section	This section refers to the step where the obtained quantitative data is analysed to, generally, identify differentially expressed molecules between the different groups of samples.  
The software used to perform the statistical analysis (ie. differential expression analysis) is specified including its version     	Bronze    	   	all  
The method used to determine the sample size and the power of the study is specified (if applicable)    	Bronze    	   	all  
Any statistical test is named and the resulting p-value/threshold specified     	Bronze    	This includes the information whether the test is one- or two-sided, paired or unpaired, as well as all additional parameters passed to the test. 	all  
The method used to correct for multiple testing is specified    	Bronze    	If correction for multiple testing was not performed, this needs to be explicitly justified.  	all  
If the software supports loading external libraries, all used libraries including their versions are specified or provided as supplementary file 	Bronze    	This refers to libraries commonly used in R, Python, or MatLab. In R, the complete environment can be easily exported using the `sessionInfo` command. 	all  
If any filtering was applied / measurement(s) excluded either manually or as part of the software algorithms, this must be clearly stated     	Bronze    	    	all  
Any transformation of data (e.g., log transformation) manually or as part of a software function/test is specified including the order that these transformations were performed    	Bronze   	   	Proteomics, ProteoGenomics     
If the software supports the export of the statistical analysis steps (for example R scripts) these are made available for review   	Silver    	We recommend the use of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) to record and share a complete analysis workflow. 	all  
If a model with multiple parameters is created, the formula for the said model is declared   	Silver   	This most commonly refers to the use of linear models, used, for example, in [limma](https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html) for the analysis of differentially expressed proteins. 	all  
If the software supports the export of the statistical analysis steps (for example R scripts) these are submitted as supplementary data   	Gold  	 We recommend the use of [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org) to record share a complete analysis workflow. 	all  
Underlying data for all figures (where applicable) is made available   	Gold   	During the downstream analysis multiple figures complement the final results of the manuscript. We recommend to make the underlying data of all figures available (where applicable) as supplementary information of the manuscript or as part of the dataset. Ideally, the code to create these figures should be made available as well (for example using [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org)). 	all
